# Adopters & community setups

Forks and stars mean people are trying this in their own stacks. If you run a loop from this repo (or adapted from it), add yourself here via PR.

## Loop Ready badge

Show your readiness level in your README:

```bash
npx @jununfly/zj-loop-audit . --badge
```

Paste the markdown output into your README. Re-run after you graduate L1 → L2 → L3.

## How to list your project

**Fast path:** [open the Add Adopter issue](https://github.com/jununfly/ZAgenticLoop/issues/new?template=add-adopter.yml) — we'll add your row.

Or open a PR that adds a row to the table below:

| Field | What to include |
|-------|-----------------|
| **Project** | Repo link or product name |
| **Pattern(s)** | e.g. Daily Triage + Issue Triage |
| **Tool** | Grok, Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, Windsurf, GitHub Actions, mixed |
| **Level** | L1 / L2 / L3 (honest) |
| **Notes** | One line — what worked or what broke |
